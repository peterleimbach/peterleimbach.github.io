# blood glucose as data field on Garmin edge 1050

When riding a road bike, it is very pleasant to keep a constant eye on your blood sugar, as the fluctuations can be very rapid due to too much insulin on board or heavy exertion. In my experience, the blood sugar on the watch is not sufficient for this.

Fortunately, Andereas May has now been able to adapt his app for various Garmin devices so that the changes really do arrive promptly on the device. Prior to this version, Garmin did not allow this due to fears of excessive battery drain.

You can find the app [here](https://apps.garmin.com/zh-TW/apps/910c3df4-8b46-45d8-9200-1eba69bc10c4).
