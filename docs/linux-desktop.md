# Linux Desktop

## Distribution

I now like to use Debian 12 on the Linux desktop.

Debian 12 has greatly simplified the use of necessary proprietary drivers and the code base is still very stable.

To be able to use current applications, I activate Flathub e.g. for Github Desktop, Visual Studio Code.

Before that, I had good experiences with both Manjaro and Arch Linux.

## Desktop Manager

I have now switched to GNOME 43.9 as my desktop, having previously worked a lot with KDE and various tiling window managers (Hyprland, Qtile).

GNOME has the advantage for me that the operation is well thought out and not many different customization options are offered. I don't want to invest any working time in customizing the desktop, at least when the alternative is as good as GNOME.
