# Linux Desktop

## my prefered setups

### Debian 12 plus Gnome 43.9

I now like to use Debian 12 on the Linux desktop with the Gnome desktop manager.

Debian 12 has greatly simplified the use of necessary proprietary drivers and the code base is still very stable.

To be able to use current applications, I activate Flathub e.g. for Github Desktop, Visual Studio Code.

I have now switched to GNOME 43.9 as my desktop, having previously worked a lot with KDE and various tiling window managers (Hyprland, Qtile).

GNOME has the advantage for me that the operation is well thought out and not many different customization options are offered. I don't want to invest any working time in customizing the desktop, at least when the alternative is as good as GNOME.

Before that, I had good experiences with both Manjaro and Arch Linux on the desktop.

### Arch linux with Qtile window manager

As alternative I use the Qtile window manager on Arch Linux which I install with the super easy archinstall skript.

Qtile has the benefit that it is written in python and it is relativly easy to extend it by myself.

Hyprland on the other hand is the rising star in Wayland as successor for X11.
